See "FinalProject" branch for Assignment 5. Run "search.py" to run.

- Created a multi-legged creature with moving "head" parts.
- Added a platform to the world and changed the z-values for the creature to place it onto the platform. 
- Altered PHC so the fitness function maximizes torso height in the z-direction instead of the x direction. This allows the creature to move along the platform.
