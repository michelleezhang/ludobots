This program generates a kinematic chain (a jointed, motorized, innervated, sensorized snake) with a random number of links (with random dimensions) and random sensor placement along the chain. Links with sensors are colored green, and links without sensors are colored blue.

Run search.py to generate a random kinematic chain.
